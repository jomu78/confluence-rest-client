## Version

Current release: `1.0.5`

This is a reworked version of [ConfluenceRestClient](https://github.com/MartinBoehmer/ConfluenceRestClient).  
This version decouples the HTTP-specific code from the Confluence client code so
that it is possible, for example, to implement the client using other third party libraries, 
or using a different form of authentication).  
This version also separates the API (now in the xxx.api package) from the implementation (in the xxx.impl package).

## Usage

You must first get a RequestService to perform REST calls.  
One called HttpAuthRequestService is provided, which uses Basic HTTP 
authentication.  
Then connect using the URI of the Confluence server and your credentials:

```java
HttpAuthRequestService requestService = new HttpAuthRequestService();
requestService.connect(new URI("https://example.com"), "admin", "admin");
```

You can then create the client factory, providing the RequestService, an 
ExecutorService, and an APIUriProvider that configures the Confluence REST 
end point:

```java
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
APIUriProvider uriProvider = new APIUriProvider(new URI(conf.getBaseUrl() + "/confluence"));
ClientFactory factory = new ClientFactoryImpl(executorService, requestService, apiConfig);
```

With this factory you can then create one of four separate clients for the different parts 
of the REST API:

* SpaceClient
* UserClient
* ContentClient
* SearchClient

To create an interface for working with content:

```java
ContentClient contentClient = clientFactory.getContentClient();
List<String> expand = new ArrayList<>();
expand.add(ExpandField.BODY_VIEW.getName());
expand.add(ExpandField.BODY_STORAGE.getName());
Future<ContentBean> future = contentClient.getContentById(123456, 0, expand);
ContentBean content = future.get();
...
```
